# Pneumonia Chest X-ray Classifier with MobileNetV2 🫁🤖

This project is a beginner-friendly deep learning solution that classifies chest X-ray images to detect pneumonia using a pretrained MobileNetV2 model. It was developed entirely in Google Colab using open-source tools and publicly available data from Kaggle.

## 📌 Project Overview

Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that can be life-threatening if not diagnosed early. This project demonstrates how AI can assist radiologists by identifying likely pneumonia cases in chest X-rays with high sensitivity, potentially improving triage and patient outcomes while saving hospitals time and costs.
